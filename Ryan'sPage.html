<h2>I love anime like Re Zero: Starting Life in Another World. I love coding and am the author for this entire site. I am a bit of a poet and love writing. I'm working on learning more HTML and plan to learn more languages for making websites. I want to learn Python so I can eventually learn to make games but, that has been set aside for now.</h2>

<h2>Angelic Gaze</h2>
<h3>What lovely phrase,<br>
Angelic Gaze,<br>
I will still praise,<br>
for future days,<br>
my eyes will raise,<br>
upon such a glaze,<br>
that over weighs,<br>
most holidays,<br>
the way it sways,<br>
Angelic Gaze.</h3>

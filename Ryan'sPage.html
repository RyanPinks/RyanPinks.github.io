<h2>I love anime like Re Zero: Starting Life in Another World. I love coding and am the author for this entire site. I am a bit of a poet and love writing. I'm working on learning more HTML and plan to learn more languages for making websites. I want to learn Python so I can eventually learn to make games but, that has been set aside for now.</h2>
<h3>Here is an example of my coding skills. This is this sites home page. Note: Right now everything will be bare bones so excuse the simple code.</h3>

    <h3>Angelic Gaze</h3>
    <h4>What lovely phrase,<br>
    Angelic Gaze,<br>
    I will still praise,<br>
    for future days,<br>
    my eyes will raise,<br>
    upon such a glaze,<br>
    that over weighs,<br>
    most holidays,<br>
    the way it sways,<br>
    Angelic Gaze.</h4>

    <h3>Tears</h3>
    <h4>Tears are rivers of love, joy and utter happiness,<br>
    Tears are echoes from the heart,<br>
    Tears are the binds that bring us together,<br>
    Tears are the doorways of understanding,<br>
    Tears are solitudes blossoms,<br>
    Tears are remorses reminders.<br>
